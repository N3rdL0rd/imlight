# Roadmap

(In no particular order)

- [x] Stage map view
- [x] Python scripting API, REPL window (or other CLI with shorthand), ability to run code inline (or an editor of sorts)
- [ ] Scroll to change selected channel type across selection
- [ ] Internal IDs separate from DMX IDs/universe for better mapping
- [ ] `Display` tab on top menu to change rendered ID (DMX or internal ID)
- [ ] Manual control layer, cue playback layer, cue control (saving and playing cues), manual control (faders)
- [ ] Integrate with cue scripting system from before
- [ ] Save and load state to a showfile
- [ ] Different icons in gridview/stageview for different types of lights
- [ ] 3D viz?
  - [ ] If we could do VR that would be sick too
- [ ] Optimizer to light specific parts of stage by brush automatically with grad-descent or NN
- [ ] Hardware integrations, homebrew firmware "driver" for colorsource boards
- [ ] Actual hardware drivers for DMX out
- [ ] Better stagemap images/select different bases (hopefully covered by @samfreund)
- [x] Snap to grid on stagemaps and maybe add special "blocking" primities (eg. scaffolding, electricals, etc) and snap to those as well
- [ ] Fix Linux wayland hidpi
- [ ] Document things better and make a help menu
- [ ] Interactive tutorial/explainer for layers
- [ ] Fader window
